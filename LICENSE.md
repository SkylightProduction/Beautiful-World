## Using
- You can download the mod from CurseForge, PlanetMinecraft and Modrinth. You can also play it freely in a local or online game. **(The mod is only officially published on these sites. If you found our mod on other websites, downloaded it, and somehow damaged your pc, then you are at fault and do not blame it on SkylightProduction).**
- You are free to use our mod in modpacks. But if you publish a modpack on sites other than CurseForge and Modrinth, in the description of the post, attach a link to our discord server. If there is no link, SuperFeda will personally contact the site administrator and ask to delete the post.
- You can use the mod on any server.
- You can use the code Beautiful World to create an addon to it. You can distribute your addon and its code wherever you like, it's your right.
## Porting and backporting
- Backport Beautiful World can only be done after receiving special permission from SuperFeda on the [Discrord server SkylightProduction](https://discord.gg/GFpmfNPPPy). Remember to write `The original mod code was created by SkylightProduction.` on the download page of your project.
- Porting our mod to a new version in case it hasn't been updated for over a year is possible. Possible without any problems. You can use the mod code for such purposes. Just don't forget to write in your project description:
`Idea author SkylightProduction, download the original mod.`
- The mod can only be ported to Quilt after obtaining official permission (available from the [SkylightProduction Discord server](https://discord.gg/GFpmfNPPPy)). After creating the mod and publishing it, leave this text in the description:
