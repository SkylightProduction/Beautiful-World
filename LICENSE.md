# Beautiful world license (BWL)
## Distribution
- Publishing the mod on unverified sites is forbidden.
- The distribution and use of textures from BW is prohibited.
- It is forbidden to use a modified version of the mod. This item can be ignored if you are using the mod as part of a modpack and only want to edit the crafting recipes or add (fix) translations. You can use such a version as long as you are allowed to do so under other licence clauses.
## Using
- You can download the mod from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beautiful-world), [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/beautiful-world-5893748/) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/beautiful-world). You can also play it freely in a local or online game.
- You are free to use our mod in modpacks. But if you publish a modpack on sites other than CurseForge and Modrinth, in the description of the post, attach a link to our discord server. If there is no link, SuperFeda will personally contact the site administrator and ask to delete the post.
- You can use Beautiful world code to create an addon for it without getting special permission.
## Porting and backporting
- Backport Beautiful World can only be done after receiving special permission from SuperFeda on the [Discrord server SkylightProduction](https://discord.gg/GFpmfNPPPy). Remember to write `The original mod code was created by SkylightProduction.` on the download page of your project.
- Porting our mod to a new version in case it hasn't been updated for over a year is possible. Possible without any problems. You can use the mod code for such purposes. Just don't forget to write in your project description:
`Idea author SkylightProduction, download the original mod: (link)`
- The mod can only be ported to **Quilt** after obtaining official permission (available from the [SkylightProduction Discord server](https://discord.gg/GFpmfNPPPy)). After creating the mod and publishing it, leave this text in the description:
`Original mod download page: (link).`
- Porting the mod to **Fabric** is not allowed.
